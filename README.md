+ ### Steps
 + [x] Gather open source libarary VRPH (Groer, 2011)
 + [x] Gather dataset used in paper
  + The 82 instances are divided into four sets."
  + [ ] Set 1 has 11 instances from TSPLIB by Belenguer et al. (2000). -> https://www.uv.es/~belengue/SDVRP/-> Forbidden access 403 error: "...Due to changes in the security policy of the UV, on March 25, 2014 ..."
  + [x] Set 2 has 14 instances randomly generated using the coordinates of eil51, eil76, and eil101 from TSPLIB by Belenguer et al. (2000)
  + [x] Set 3 has 36 instances generated by Archetti et al. (2008).
  + [x] Set 4 has 21 instances from Chen et al. (2007).
		
 + [x] Implement *a priori* split strategy 
 + [x] Setup initial testing (dataset + makefile)
 + [ ] Optimization to achieve paper results
 + [ ] Optimization for better result
