 ###Steps
 + [x] Gather open source libarary VRPH (Groer, 2011)
 + [ ] Gather dataset used in paper


  +"The 82 instances are divided into four sets."
   +[ ] Set 1 has 11 instances from TSPLIB by Belenguer et al. (2000).
    +[ ] "... a set of 11 instances from the TSPLIB (Reinelt 1991 ... These instances are publically available via http:www.uv.es/∼belengue/SDVRP/sdvrplib.html."
      + https://www.uv.es/~belengue/SDVRP/: Forbidden access 403 error: "...Due to changes in the security policy of the UV, on March 25, 2014 ..."**
      + I'll keep trying to look for the instances
   +[ ] Set 2 has 14 instances randomly generated using the coordinates of eil51, eil76, and eil101 from TSPLIB by Belenguer et al. (2000)
   +[ ] Set 3 has 36 instances generated by Archetti et al. (2008).
   +[ ] Set 4 has 21 instances from Chen et al. (2007).
		
 + [ ] Implement *a priori* split strategy 
 + [ ] Setup initial testing (dataset + makefile)
 + [ ] Optimization to achieve paper results
 + [ ] Optimization for better result
